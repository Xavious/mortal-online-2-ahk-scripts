# AHK for Mortal Online 2

## What is it?
This is a small collection of AutoHotkey scripts for MO2. I've tried to document features in the actual script files, and I might spend some time doing that here one day â„¢

## AutoHotkey Modifiers

`^` - ctrl

`!` - shift

`+` - alt

Example:
```
^g::
  controlsend,, {4}, Mortal Online 2
  controlsend,, {8}, Mortal Online 2
```

Pushing `ctrl+g` sends two keypresses to the application, in this case `4` followed by `8`. This allows you to create your own key modifiers in situations where this level of complexity and control isn't facilitated by the game client.

## Simulating holding a key down

You can use the basic format of `{<key> Down/Up}` to either have a key pressed down, or to release it back up again. 

Example:
```
ControlSend, , {b Down}, Mortal Online 2
ControlSend, , {b Up}, Mortal Online 2

ControlSend, , {LButton Down}, Mortal Online 2
ControlSend, , {LButton Up}, Mortal Online 2
```

The first example is pushing down the `b` key, then releasing it. The second example is to show the syntax for the left mouse buttons. There is also `RButton` (right click) and `MButton` scroll wheel middle button. The full list of keys can be found here:
